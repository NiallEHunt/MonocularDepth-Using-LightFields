INTRODUCTION
============

This file provides submission instructions for the 4D Light Field Benchmark.

The benchmark consists of 12 scenes:
- 4 stratified scenes (Backgammon, Pyramids, Dots, Stripes)
- 4 training scenes (Boxes, Cotton, Dino, Sideboard)
- 4 test scenes (Bedroom, Bicycle, Herbs, Origami)

You may use our evaluation toolkit to validate submissions and to evaluate
your method on the stratified and training scenes. Please check out the
README for further information on the software features.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

1) Run your stereo algorithm.
     INPUT:
     Per scene, you may use the 81 light field views and the disparity
     ranges as provided in the "parameters.cfg". You are not allowed to
     use any of the provided evaluation masks for your depth estimation.
     YOU ARE REQUESTED TO USE ONLY ONE SET OF PARAMETERS FOR ALL 12 SCENES.

     OUTPUT:
     Please report a 512x512 disparity map in PFM format and the runtime
     in seconds for each of the 12 scenes. Have a look at the baseline
     algorithms for examples of the expected file formats. We provide
     Matlab and Python tools with PFM read/write utilities on our website.

     Official PFM documentation: http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pfm.html


2) Finalize and validate your submission.
     Create a zip file with the following file structure:

     algo.zip
       |-- disp_maps
           |-- backgammon.pfm
           |-- bedroom.pfm
           |-- ...
       |-- runtimes
           |-- backgammon.txt
           |-- bedroom.txt
           |-- ...

     You may use the "validate_submission.py" to check your submission.


3) Upload your results.
     To submit your results and to manage your submissions, please
     log in to our website: www.lightfield-analysis.net
     Create a new submission, enter details about your method, and
     upload your zip archive.


4) Check out your performance scores.
     You will get notified via email as soon as your submission was
     successfully evaluated and approved. Go to the benchmark
     visualizations to check your scores and rankings.
